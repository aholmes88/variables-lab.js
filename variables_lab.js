//Objective
//Students will:
//1. Practice declaring and initializing variables using let and const.
//2. Print variables and their values using console.log.
//3. Perform mathematical operations with variables.
//4. Understand and use basic JavaScript operators.
//Instructions
//Part 1: Setting Up
//1. Open your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
//2. Create a new file named variables-lab.js.
//Part 2: Tasks
//Task 1: Declare and Print Variables
//1. Declare variables using let for:
//â—‹ Your name (string).
let age = 36
//â—‹ Your favorite number (number).
let favoriteNumber = 7
//â—‹ A boolean indicating whether you like JavaScript (true or false).
let likeJavaScript = true
//2. Print each variable's value using console.log.
console.log("My age is ", age ,"and my favorite number is ", favoriteNumber,"and I like JavaScript, it is very ", likeJavaScript)
//Example Output:
//My name is John.
//My favorite number is 7.
//Do I like JavaScript? true
//Task 2: Update and Reassign Variables
//1. Declare a let variable for your current age.
let currentAge = 36
//2. Reassign the variable to simulate your age next year (add 1).
currentAge = currentAge + 1
//3. Print the updated value.
console.log("My current age is ", currentAge)
//Task 3: Constants
//1. Declare a constant const variable for the number of days in a week.
const daysInWeek = 7
//2. Try reassigning the constant and observe what happens.
//daysInWeek = 10 // This will throw an error
//3. Print the value of the constant.
console.log("There are ", daysInWeek, "days in a week")
//Task 4: Mathematical Operations
//1. Declare two let variables to store two numbers of your choice.
let num1 = 10
let num2 = 5
let num = (num1 + num2)
let subNum = (num1 - num2)
let mulNum = (num1 * num2)
let divNum = (num1 / num2)
let modNum = (num1 % num2)
let powNum = (num1 ** num2)
//2. Perform and print the results of the following operations:
//â—‹ Addition
console.log("The sum of ", num1, "and ", num2, "is" , num)
//â—‹ Subtraction
console.log("The difference of ", num1, "and ", num2, "is" ,subNum)
//â—‹ Multiplication
console.log("The product of ", num1, "and ", num2, "is" ,mulNum)
//â—‹ Division
console.log("The quotient of ", num1, "and ", num2, "is" ,divNum)
//â—‹ Modulus (remainder)
console.log("The remainder of ", num1, "and ", num2, "is" ,modNum)
//â—‹ Exponentiation
console.log("The result of ", num1, "to the power of ", num2, "is" ,powNum)
//Example Output:
//Addition: 15 + 5 = 20
//Subtraction: 15 - 5 = 10
//Multiplication: 15 * 5 = 75
//Division: 15 / 5 = 3
//Modulus: 15 % 5 = 0
//Task 5: String Concatenation
//1. Declare a let variable for your first name and another for your last name.
//2. Concatenate the two variables to form your full name.
//3. Print your full name using console.log.
//Example Output:
//My full name is John Doe.
//Part 3: Bonus Task (Optional)
//1. Declare a variable for a product's price and another for the quantity purchased.
//2. Calculate the total cost (price Ã— quantity).
//3. Print the total cost in a formatted message.
//Example Output:
//The total cost for 3 items at $10 each is $30.
//ðŸŽ‰ Submission
//1. Save your file as variables-lab.js.
//2. Push your file to a GitHub repository named javascript-basics-lab.
//3. Share the GitHub repository link with the instructor.
